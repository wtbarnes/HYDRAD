# Initial Conditions
Outline for how initial conditions are generated by GUI and then read in by initial conditions code.
## `Initial_Conditions/config/initial_conditions.cfg`
The structure of the initial conditions configuration file is as as follows:

| Variable Target | Description |
|:--------------- |:-----------:|
| `pParams->szOutputFilename` | initial conditions output file to be read by HYDRAD |
| `pParams->Lfull`			  | loop length (in cm) 								|
| `pParams->Inc` 			  | loop inclination from vertical (in degrees) 		|
| `pParams->s0` | foot-point height (in cm) |
| `pParams->T0` | foot-point temperature (in K); if ISOTHERMAL, then this is the loop temperature |
| `pParams->n0` | foot-point density (in cm<sup>-3</sup>) |
| `pParams->sH0` | heating location (in cm) |
| `pParams->SH` | heating scale height (in cm) |
| `pParams->log_10H0[0]` | log<sub>10</sub> OOM lower bound on heating range search (in erg cm<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) |
| `pParams->log_10H0[1]` | log<sub>10</sub> OOM upper bound on heating range search (in erg cm<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) |
| `pParams->dlog_10H0` | log space search step size |
| `pParams->Hintervals` | linear space fine tune intervals |



All of these files are read in by `void GetConfigurationParameters()` in `Initial_Conditions/source/misc.cpp` as called by `Initial_Conditions/source/main.cpp`. It is assumed (i.e. hardcoded) that the configuration file is at `Initial_Conditions/config/initial_conditions.cfg`. The parameters are read in line-by-line in the order shown in the table above. 

## `Initial_Conditions/source/config.h`
TODO: Here, list all of the `#ifdef` vars that get defined. May have to look at GUI source to sort this out.
## `Radiation_Model/config/elements_{eq,neq}.cfg`
TODO: List all of variable mappings as they are read into the radiation model code.
## `Radiation_Model/source/config.h`
TODO: Here, list all of the `#ifdef` vars that get defined. May have to look at GUI source to sort this out.
