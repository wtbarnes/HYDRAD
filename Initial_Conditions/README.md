# Initial Conditions
Outline for how initial conditions are generated by GUI and then read in by initial conditions code.
##`Initial_Conditions/config/initial_conditions.cfg`
The structure of the initial conditions configuration file is as as follows:

| Variable Target | Description |
|:--------------- |:-----------:|
| `pParams->szOutputFilename` | initial conditions output file to be read by HYDRAD |
| `pParams->Lfull`			  | loop length (in cm) 								|
| `pParams->Inc` 			  | loop inclination from vertical (in degrees) 		|
| `pParams->s0` | foot-point height (in cm) |
| `pParams->T0` | foot-point temperature (in K); if ISOTHERMAL, then this is the loop temperature |
| `pParams->n0` | foot-point density (in cm<sup>-3</sup>) |
| `pParams->sH0` | heating location (in cm) |
| `pParams->SH` | heating scale height (in cm) |


All of these files are read in by `void GetConfigurationParameters()` in `Initial_Conditions/source/misc.cpp` as called by `Initial_Conditions/source/main.cpp`. It is assumed (i.e. hardcoded) that the configuration file is at `Initial_Conditions/config/initial_conditions.cfg`.
