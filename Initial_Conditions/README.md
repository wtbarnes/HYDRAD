# Initial Conditions
Outline for how initial conditions are generated by GUI and then read in by initial conditions code.
## `Initial_Conditions/config/initial_conditions.cfg`
The structure of the initial conditions configuration file is as as follows:

| Variable Target | Type | Description |
|:---------------:|:---- |:-----------|
| `pParams->szOutputFilename` | `char` array | initial conditions (root) output file to be printed by IC and read by HYDRAD |
| `pParams->Lfull`			  | float (scientific) | loop length (in cm) 								|
| `pParams->Inc` 			  | float | loop inclination from vertical (in degrees) 		|
| `pParams->s0` | float (scientific) | foot-point height (in cm) |
| `pParams->T0` | float (scientific) | foot-point temperature (in K); if ISOTHERMAL, then this is the loop temperature |
| `pParams->n0` | float (scientific) | foot-point density (in cm<sup>-3</sup>) |
| `pParams->sH0` | float (scientific) | heating location (in cm) |
| `pParams->SH` | float (scientific) | heating scale height (in cm) |
| `pParams->log_10H0[0]` | float | log<sub>10</sub> OOM lower bound on heating range search (in erg cm<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) |
| `pParams->log_10H0[1]` | float | log<sub>10</sub> OOM upper bound on heating range search (in erg cm<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) |
| `pParams->dlog_10H0` | float | log space search step size |
| `pParams->Hintervals` | float | linear space fine tune intervals |



All of these files are read in by `void GetConfigurationParameters()` in `Initial_Conditions/source/misc.cpp` as called by `Initial_Conditions/source/main.cpp`. It is assumed (i.e. hardcoded) that the configuration file is at `Initial_Conditions/config/initial_conditions.cfg`. The parameters are read in line-by-line in the order shown in the table above. 

## `Initial_Conditions/source/config.h`
This header file sets a series of `#defines` that are used like global variables. These are set by the GUI. These are divided into several different categories.
